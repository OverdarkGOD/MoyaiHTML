# Updates
Since the website is being developed, there will contain bugs that I may not know about. Readers may submit an issue regarding the site. That being said, the website has undergone a lot of improvements.

##All of the webpages: 
- All of the webpages use a neat detailed wave header containing the tile of my website. 
- All of the webpages use a decent footer that contains all of the links to every webpage.

##Home Webpage:
- The homepage *index.html* contains three sections of:
  - The first section is for announcements that I state for users. Statements will vary.
  - The second section is for summarized updates of the website.
  - The third section is to promote my Discord Bot.
##Service Webpage:
- The service webpage contains the IT services I provide for consumers.
- The webpage contains a section dedicated for redirecting to a different webpage. *otherservices.html*
##Donate Webpage:
- The donate webpage contains three sources of payment methods use if a consumer or user wants to support the web developer.

##To Be Added
There are many things I still have to add to the website before it is "completed". Not all of the links will work correctly. Majority of the links are going to be policy links. That is because it will take me a period of time to understand and read my own policies word by word before publishing it to the website.
